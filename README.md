# YouTube API

_Coding Test_

A Node API built with Express, and using MySQL on the database.

This API exposes an endpoint, that when hit will store YouTube video `titles` and `publishedAt` dates for the `GlobalCyclingNetwork` and `globalmtb` YouTube channels to a database. This will only store videos that match the filter criteria.

## Getting Started

After installing the dependencies using `npm install`, you can run the application from the console using the commands:

```
npm start
```

The **API** will be running on:
[localhost:3000](http://localhost:5000/ "http://localhost:3000/")
