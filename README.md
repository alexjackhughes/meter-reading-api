# Meter Reading API

_(Coding Test)_

A Node API built with Express/Node and MongoDB.

This is a new service for accepting meter reads. The main goal here is to _accept_, _store_ and _present_ meter readings based on a customer's unique identifier.

## Getting Started

After installing the dependencies using `npm install` in the root folder, you can run the application from the console using the commands:

```
npm start
```

The **API** will be running on:
[localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000/ "http://localhost:3000/")
